# My Personal Project

## A food ordering and delivery app

### Abstract

- **Functions**

 *This app can order food and set the food delivered time.*

- **Users**

*Users can be those who want to order the food of the restaurant online and need the food delivery service.*

- **Reason for my interest in this project**

*Due to the Covid-19, many restaurants are close for dine-in and only allow delivery. In addition, many customers
are too busy to go to the restaurants in person. This app can facilitate the life of the customers by saving
their time and making the food of the restaurant that only allows delivery available to them.*
